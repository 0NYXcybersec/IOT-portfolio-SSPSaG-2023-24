## Introduction
My IOT projects portfolio for the SSPÅ aG admission process of the year 2023/24.
## Projects
### Ultrasonic distance detector
The code uses an ultrasonic sensor to measure the distance of an object in front of it and lights up different colored LEDs based on the distance. The code defines the pins for the ultrasonic sensor, as well as the pins for the green, yellow, and red LEDs.
### Joystick controlled LEDs
```python

### P.W.H mk.1
```
Plant watering hub mark.1
```
This code is designed to control two LEDs based on the water level in the soil detected by a soil sensor. The code is written for an Arduino board, which can interface with the sensor and LEDs.

When the soil sensor detects a full water level, the code turns on the green LED and turns off the red LED. When the water level is low, the code turns on the red LED and turns off the green LED. The code repeats this process indefinitely, with a delay of 250 milliseconds between each reading of the sensor.

## Introduction
My IOT projects portfolio for the SSPÅ aG admission process of the year 2023/24.
## Projects
### Ultrasonic distance detector
The code uses an ultrasonic sensor to measure the distance of an object in front of it and lights up different colored LEDs based on the distance. The code defines the pins for the ultrasonic sensor, as well as the pins for the green, yellow, and red LEDs.
### Joystick controlled LEDs

### P.W.H mk.1

This code is designed to control two LEDs based on the water level in the soil detected by a soil sensor. The code is written for an Arduino board, which can interface with the sensor and LEDs.

When the soil sensor detects a full water level, the code turns on the green LED and turns off the red LED. When the water level is low, the code turns on the red LED and turns off the green LED. The code repeats this process indefinitely, with a delay of 250 milliseconds between each reading of the sensor.
### P.W.H mk.2

The P.W.H mk.2 is an electronic control system designed to manage and regulate the operation of a water pump, primarily in household applications. This system is an updated version of the original P.W.H mk.1, featuring useful features and functionalities that make it more efficient and reliable.

The key function of the P.W.H mk.2 is to control the water pump automatically. This is achieved by utilizing digital input from the soil sensor to detect when the plants or crops require watering. When the soil sensor detects that the moisture level in the soil has dropped below a certain threshold, it sends a signal to the board to activate the water pump. The board then sends a signal to the water pump to start pumping water from a designated source such as a well, a borehole or a storage tank, and directs it to the irrigation system.

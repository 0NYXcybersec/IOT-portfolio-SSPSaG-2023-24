# Maker-portfolio-SSPSaG-2023-24
## Introduction
My arduino projects portfolio for the SSPÅ aG admission process of the year 2023/24.
## Projects
### Ultrasonic distance detector
The code uses an ultrasonic sensor to measure the distance of an object in front of it and lights up different colored LEDs based on the distance. The code defines the pins for the ultrasonic sensor, as well as the pins for the green, yellow, and red LEDs.
### Joystick controlled LEDs
